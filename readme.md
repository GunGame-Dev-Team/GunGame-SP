# GunGame

## Introduction
GunGame is a plugin created using the [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python) server plugin for Source-engine games.  As such, it requires [Source.Python](https://github.com/Source-Python-Dev-Team/Source.Python) to be installed on your CS:S or CS:GO game server.

GunGame is a leveling mod where players must advance weapon-by-weapon.  The first player to get through all weapons is the winner.
